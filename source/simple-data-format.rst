Simple Data Format (SDF)
========================

:**Version**: 1.0 beta
:**Last Updated**: 18 April 2013
:**Created**: May 7 2012

This document defines a simple data publishing format (Simple Data Format) for
publishing and sharing tabular-style data.

The format's focus is on simplicity and ease of use over the web -- that is,
usage online with access and transmission *over HTTP*. In addition the format
is focused on data that can be presented in a tabular structure and in making
it easy to produce (and consume) this format from spreadsheets and relational
databases.

The key features of this format are the following:

* CSV (comma separated variables) for data
* Single JSON file (datapackage.json) to describe the dataset including a
  schema for data files
* Reuse wherever possible of existing work including other Data Protocols
  specifications

Quick Start
===========

A Simple Data Format dataset has:

* Data files in CSV
* (Minimal) dataset information in JSON (including a schema for the CSV)

Here's an example of a minimal simple data format dataset::

  2 files

  data.csv
  datapackage.json

  
  data.csv
  --------

  var1,var2,var3
  A,1,2
  B,3,4
  
  datapackage.json
  ----------------

  {
    "name": "my-dataset",
    # here we list the data files in this dataset
    "resources": [
      {
        "path": "data.csv",
        "schema": {
          "fields": [
            {
              "id": "var1",
              "type": "string"
            },
            {
              "id": "var2",
              "type": "integer"
            },
            {
              "id": "var3",
              "type": "number"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }


Specification
=============

This specification is in large part a refinement of the :doc:`Data Packages
specification <data-packages>`. It has the additional requirements such as:

* All data files MUST be in CSV format
* A schema following JSON Table Schema MUST be provided for each data file that
  is part of the data package

Files
-----

* A dataset in Simple Data Format is a data package and MUST therefore have a package descriptor (datapackage.json) file (and that file MUST contain the metadata required by
  the Data Package specification)
* A dataset MUST contain at least one or more *data files*

Each data file:

* MUST be in CSV format and its file name MUST end with ``.csv``.
* MUST have a single header row. This row MUST be the first row in the file.

  * Terminology: each column in the CSV file is termed a *field* and its *id*
    is the string in that column in the header row.
  * The id MUST be unique amongst fields and MUST contain at least one character
  * There are no further restrictions on the form of the id but it is
    RECOMMENDED that it contain only alphanumeric characters together with " .-_"

* Associated to each file MUST be an entry in the resources attribute in the datapackage.json
  file.
* The schema attribute of each resources entry in the package descriptor MUST be present and its value
  MUST conform to the JSON Table Schema and MUST describe the fields in the
  associated data file.

CSV Format
----------

There is an RFC for CSV (:rfc:`4180` - Common Format and MIME Type for
Comma-Separated Values (CSV) Files). The CSV file MUST follow these additional
restrictions:

* Be encoded as UTF-8
* NOT contain more fields than are in the header row (though they may contain
  less)

The CSV file SHOULD follow these additional restrictions regarding CSV
structure:

* Use "," as field delimiters
* Use "\r\n" or "\n" as line terminators

If the CSV file does not follow these dialect information MUST be provided in
the file entry as per :doc:`CSV Dialect Description Format <csv-dialect>`.


Key Design Features and Principles
==================================

The format's focus is on simplicity and web usage -- that is, usage online with
access and transmission *over HTTP*. In addition the format is focused on data
that can be presented in a tabular structure and in making it easy to produce
(and consume) this format from spreadsheets and relational databases.

The key features of this format are the following:

* CSV (comma separated variables) as the base data format
* JSON as the base format for schema definition
* Reuse wherever possible of existing work including other Data Protocols specifications


Why CSV
-------

1. CSV is very simple - it is perhaps *the* most simple data format
2. CSV is tabular-oriented. Most data structures are either tabular or can be
   transformed to a tabular structure by some form of normalization
3. It is open and the "standard" is well-known
4. It is widely supported - practically every spreadsheet program, relational
   database and programming language in existence can handle CSV in some form
   or other
5. It is text-based and therefore amenable to manipulation and access from a
   wide range of standard tools (including revision control systems such as
   git, mercurial and subversion)
6. It is line-oriented which means it can be incrementally processed -- you do
   not need to read an entire file to extract a single row. For similar reasons
   it means that the format supports streaming.

Why JSON
--------

* JSON is simple
* JSON supports rich structure including nesting and basic types
* JSON is very widely used and supported (all major programming languages can
  handle JSON)
* JSON is web-native (every browser can access and manipulate JSON)
* JSON is readable as simple text making it amenable to management and
  processing using simple text tools


Open Issues
===========

* Foreign keys between files
* Primary keys and uniqueness

Alternatives Discussion
=======================

What alternatives are there for the data portion of the Simple Data format?

* Use line oriented JSON (?)

  * Greater flexibility and complexity on types and objects
  * No support from spreadsheets

* Use SQLite

  * (+) compact, full DB in one
  * (-) lack of support (e.g. from spreadsheets), no streaming, not accessible with text tools etc

.. note:: this specification owes a great deal to the excellent Dataset
          Publishing Language (DSPL) put forward by Google. The main difference
          is in using JSON instead of XML for the schema and re-using as far as
          possible the JSON-LD schema language (based on linked-data) rather
          than inventing a new type and schema structure.

Alternative CSV format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This describes a possible alternative CSV-based format for serializing the
metadata. It has the advantage that you could then put a single dataset in one
spreadsheet (using multiple sheets).

In this format each key in the JSON file becomes a column. In addition there is
one initial column named @key@. Values for this column are then attribute
names. To illustrate (spacing for illustrative purposes only)::

  @key@, year, series, ...
  @type, ...,  xsd:string
  simpletype, date, string
  label, ....
  ...
